      When we model peaceful and loving relationships, our children feel more secure and loved. Positive language, active listening, and empathy help maintain a peaceful and happy family environment these stressful times.

    <h2>We are models for our kids.</h2>
    <ul>
      <l>How we talk and behave in front of others is a big influence  on how they behave too!</li>
        <l>Try to talk kindly to everyone in the family, adults and children.</l>
        <l>Bad communication between adults in the household can hae a negative impact on our children.</l>
        <l>The more we practise modelling peaceful, loving relationships for our children the moresecure and loved they will feel.</l>

    <h2>Share the load</h2>
    <ul>
      <l>Lookin after children and other family members is difficult, but it's much easier when responsibilities are shared.</l>
      <l>Try to share households chores, childcare and other tasks equally amongst family members.</l>
      <l>Create a schedule for time "on" and time "off" with other adults in your household.</l>
      <l>It is okay to ask for help when you are feeling tired or stressed so that you can take a break.</l>
    </ul>
    <h2>Feeling stressed or angry?</h2>
    <ul>
      <l>Give yourself a 10-second pause. Breathe in and out slowly five minutes. Then try to respond in a calmer way. Millions of parents say this helps -A LOT</l>
      <L>Call a truce when you can see arguments building up, and go into anther room or outside if you can</L>
      <l>See tip sheets on "When we Get Angry" and "Keep calm and Manage stress"</l>

    <h2>Use positive language. It works! </h2>
    <ul>
      <l>Tell others what you want them to do instead of what you don't want them to do: instead of "Stop shouting," try "Please  speak more quietly"</l>
      <l>Praise makes others feel appreciated and good bout themselves. Simple words like, "Thank you for clearing the dinner," or "Thank you for watching the baby" can make a big difference</l>
  </ul>

   <h2>Nice things to do together as a family</h2>
   <ul>
     <l>Let each family member take turns to choose a whole-family activity each day</l>
     <l>Find ways to spend quality time with your partner and other adults in your home, too!</l>
   </ul>

    <h2>Be an empathetic active listener</h2>
    <ul>
      <l>Listen to others when they are talking with you</l>
      <l>Be open and show them that you hear what they are saying</l>
      <l>It can help to even summarise what you have heard before responding: "What I hear you saying is..."</l>
    </ul>
