    <h2>Share the load</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lookin after children and other family members is difficult, but it's much easier when responsibilities are shared.</li>
      <li>Try to share households chores, childcare and other tasks equally amongst family members.</li>
      <li>Create a schedule for time "on" and time "off" with other adults in your household.</li>

    <h2>Feeling stressed or angry?</h2>

      <li>Call a truce when you can see arguments building up, and go into anther room or outside if you can</li>
      <li>See tip sheets on "When we Get Angry" and "Keep calm and Manage stress"</li>

    <h2>Use positive language. It works! </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tell others what you want them to do instead of what you don't want them to do: instead of "Stop shouting," try "Please  speak more quietly"</li>
      <li>Praise makes others feel appreciated and good bout themselves. Simple words like, "Thank you for clearing the dinner," or "Thank you for watching the baby" can make a big difference</li>
  </ul>
