      <li>
        Step 1: Set up
        <ul>
          <li>
            Find a comfortable sitting position, your feet flat on the floor,
            your hands resting in your lap.
          </li>
          <li>Close your eyes if you feel comfortable.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Think, feel, body
        <ul>
          <li>Ask yourself, "What am I thinking now?"</li>
          <li>
            Notice your thoughts. Notice if they are negative or positive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notice how you feel emotionally. Notice if your feelings are happy
            or not.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notice how your body feels. Notice anything that hurts or is tense.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: Focus on your breath
        <ul>
          <li>Listen to your breath as it goes in and out.</li>
          <li>
            You can put a hand on your stomach and feel it rise and fall with
            each breath.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may want to say to yourself "It's okay. Whatever it is, I am
            okay."
          </li>
          <li>Then just listen to your breath for a while.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Coming back
        <ul>
          <li>Notice how your whole body feels.</li>
          <li>Listen to the sounds in the room.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5: Reflecting
        <ul>
          <li>Think 'do I feel different at all?'</li>
          <li>When you are ready, open your eyes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
