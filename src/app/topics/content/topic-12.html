    <h2>Keep your child safe with open communication</h2>
    <p>
      Tell your children that if they experience sometihng online that makes them feel upset,uncomfortable or scared,they can talk to you and you will not get mad or punish them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be alert to signs of distress. Notice if your child is being withdrawn, upset, secretive, or obsessed with online activities
    </p>
    <p>
      Create trusting relationships and open communication through positive support and encouragement
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that every child is unique and may use different ways to communicate. Take time to adjust your message for your child's needs. For example, children with learning disabilities, may require information in simple format
