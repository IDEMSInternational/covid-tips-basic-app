      We spend a lot of time indoors with a young baby, and Covid-19 makes it much more intense. 
      It is completely normal to feel isolated, overwhelmed, anxious, and scared for you and your baby.

<h2>Be gentle with your children 
  as they learn, but also with 
  yourself as the parent!</h2>
<p>Just because something didn’t go well today, or 
  you lost your temper, this doesn’t define who you 
  are as a parent. Remind yourself of the things 
  you did well today, even if they may seem small</p>

            <li>Keep calm and take a break! 
              You can place your baby in a 
              safe place on their back, and 
              then walk away. Be sure to 
              check on your baby every 5 to 
              10 minutes</li>
              <li>If you think your baby is injured 
                or ill, call a health service 
                provider or visit a clinic.</li>
