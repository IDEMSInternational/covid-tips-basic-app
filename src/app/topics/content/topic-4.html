      All children misbehave. It is normal when children are tired, hungry,
      afraid, or learning independence. And they can drive us crazy when stuck
      at home.

    <h2>Redirect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Catch bad behavior early and redirect your kids' attention from a bad to
        a good behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stop it before it starts! When they start to get restless, you can
        distract with something interesting or fun: "Come, let's go outside for
        a walk!"
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Consequences</h2>
    <p>
      Consequences help teach our children responsibility for what they do. They
      also allow discipline that is controlled. This is more effective than
      hitting or shouting
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Give your child a choice to follow your instruction before giving them
        the consequence.
      </li>
      <li>Try to stay calm when giving the consequence.</li>
      <li>
        Make sure you can follow through with the consequence. For example,
        taking away a teenager's phone for a week is hard to enforce. Taking it
        away for one hour is more realistic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the consequence is over, give your child a chance to do something
        good, and praise them for it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Take a Pause</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Feel like screaming? Give yourself a 10-second pause. Breathe in and out
        slowly five times. Then try to respond in a calmer way.
      </li>
      <li>Millions of parents say this helps - A LOT.</li>

    <h2>Keep using Tips 1-3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One-on-One time, praise for being good, and consistent routines will
        reduce bad behaviour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give your children and teens simple jobs with responsibilities. Just
        make sure it is something they are able to do. And praise them when they
        do it!
